# EHR-Alert-Analysis-Dashboard
# 📊 Smarter Clinical Alert Dashboard (Power BI)

This project explores patterns in clinical alerts using synthetic EHR data and simulates an AI-based dismissal risk scoring system.

⚠️ Heads up!

There’s no live dashboard link because I built this using Power BI Web (free version). Since I’m working on a Mac, I can’t use Power BI Desktop — and the web version doesn’t support dashboard sharing without a paid license. So for now, it’s screenshots only 🙂


## 🔍 What it Does

- Visualizes clinical alerts by type and severity
- Shows dismissal patterns by clinicians
- Simulates an AI "Dismissal Likelihood Score"
- Built entirely in Power BI Web, using a preprocessed dataset
